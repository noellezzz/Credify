# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. OrganizationFeed.jsx - 401 Infinite Loop
**Problem:** Component was making infinite requests to `/organizations/events/manage` causing 1,719+ requests when user is not properly authenticated as an organization.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `hasErrorRef` to track error state and prevent retries on error
- Added proper 401 error handling that logs out user and redirects to organization login
- Added memoized `organizationId` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented conditional fetching that stops on authentication errors
- Added proper error display with contextual messages

### 2. OrganizationVerifications.jsx - 500 Server Error Loop
**Problem:** Component was making infinite requests to `/organizations/verification-requests` on server errors (500), causing continuous failed requests.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `hasFetchedRef` and `hasErrorRef` to prevent infinite retries
- Added 500 error detection and handling to stop retry attempts
- Added 401 authentication error handling with logout and redirect
- Added comprehensive error display with retry button (only for recoverable errors)
- Added manual retry functionality that resets error state

## Key Changes

### OrganizationFeed.jsx:
1. Added proper imports: `useNavigate`, `logoutOrganization`
2. Added error tracking refs: `hasErrorRef`
3. Added useEffect for error handling with logout/redirect logic
4. Updated error display to show different messages for different error types
5. Removed retry button for 401 errors (shows "Redirecting..." instead)

### OrganizationVerifications.jsx:
1. Added proper imports: `useNavigate`, `logoutOrganization`, `FiAlertTriangle`
2. Added error tracking refs: `hasFetchedRef`, `hasErrorRef`
3. Added useEffect for error handling with logout/redirect logic
4. Added comprehensive error display section with conditional styling
5. Added `handleRetryFetch` function that resets error state

## Testing Steps

1. Test with valid organization authentication - should fetch data normally
2. Test with invalid/expired organization token - should show 401 error and redirect to login
3. Test with server errors - should show error message and stop infinite requests
4. Test retry functionality - should allow manual retry for recoverable errors

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/organization/OrganizationFeed.jsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/organization/OrganizationVerifications.jsx`

## Expected Behavior
- No more infinite API calls in network tab
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Automatic logout and redirect for authentication issues
- Graceful handling of server errors without infinite retries
