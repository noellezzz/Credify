# Organization Management System Implementation

## Overview
- Features that need to be implemented is an Organization Management platform where organizations can:
1. Register and get verified as legitimate organizations
2. Post and manage events/courses
3. View Certificate Verification Requests from users
4. Approve/Reject Verification Requests
5. Organization Dashboard with analytics

- For users, users can browse verified organizations' events/courses and if the event has verification option, they can upload their certificates and submit them for verification by the organization

## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Organizations table
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  website VARCHAR(255),
  address TEXT,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  organization_type ENUM('university', 'college', 'training_center', 'certification_body', 'corporate', 'government', 'nonprofit', 'other'),
  description TEXT,
  logo_url TEXT,
  verification_status ENUM('pending', 'verified', 'rejected'),
  verification_documents TEXT[], -- Array of document URLs
  verified_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Events table (now linked to organizations)
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  event_type ENUM('graduation', 'certification', 'award', 'workshop', 'course', 'training', 'conference'),
  requires_verification BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  event_date DATE,
  application_deadline DATE,
  status ENUM('draft', 'published', 'closed'),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Certificate Verification Requests
CREATE TABLE verification_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  certificate_file_url TEXT,
  participant_name VARCHAR(255),
  participant_id VARCHAR(100),
  completion_date DATE,
  status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'),
  reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  review_notes TEXT,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP,
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

   - Overview statistics (total events, pending requests, verification status)
   - Recent activity feed
   - Quick action buttons
   - Organization verification status banner

2. **Events Management** (`/organization/events`)
   - List of all events with status
   - Create/Edit event forms
   - Event preview and publish functionality

3. **Verification Requests** (`/organization/verifications`)
   - Table of all verification requests for organization's events
   - Filter by status, event, date
   - Individual request review modal

4. **Profile Settings** (`/organization/profile`)
   - Organization information management
   - Verification document uploads
   - Account settings

### User-Facing Pages
1. **Organizations Browse** (`/organizations`)
   - Public listing of all verified organizations
   - Search and filter functionality by type, location

2. **Organization Profile** (`/organizations/:id`)
   - Organization details and credentials
   - List of organization's events
   - Organization verification status

3. **Events Browse** (`/events`)
   - Public listing of all published events
   - Search and filter functionality

4. **Event Details** (`/events/:id`)
   - Full event information
   - Organization details
   - Certificate verification request form (if applicable)

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Organization registration, verification, and profile management
2. **Phase 2**: Events creation and management
3. **Phase 3**: Certificate verification request system
4. **Phase 4**: Organization dashboard and analytics
5. **Phase 5**: Public organization and event browsing system

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (organizations vs users)
- Organization verification process with document validation
- File upload validation and scanning
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure file storage for certificates and verification documents
